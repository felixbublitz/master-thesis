<h1>Evaluation of an efficient web-based video conferencing approach using image reconstruction from face-meshes</h1>


The aim of this thesis was to investigate, whether landmark-based alternative video trans-
mission approaches are suitable for the web. These alternative approaches were already
proposed for the bandwidth reduction in web conferences. However, the applicability for
web applications is uncharted by now. For this purpose, a web evaluation framework
was developed, enabling the realization and testing of various alternative transmission
methods. For a proof-of-concept, two approaches were implemented: A face swapping
and a 3D puppetry approach. It could be proved, that facial based bandwidth reduction
methods are suitable for the application in the web. Merely, the processing times on the
tested mobile phone were too high to achieve a fluent video conversation. It has to be
further investigated, if improved methods can be developed with better visual quality and
compatibility.
